# Scala multi-room chat example

This is a more complex chat server example written with Play socket.io. It shows how to use dynamic Pekko streams, allowing users to dynamically join and leave chat room flows.

To run this example, from the root directory of `play-socket.io`, run `sbt scalaMultiRoomChat/run`.
